# TODO

## Pages

- User roles? Sign in to enable join/unjoin?
- remember user name (localStorage) - or require login?
- Join ride / unjoin ride (user can only add/remove themselves)
- Once joined, hide JoinButton from all other rides on same day

- Should ride details be a new page? /ride/{id}

## Admin/Leader

- View of rides on calendar (list)
- Add / edit ride form
- delete ride
- (https://github.com/moodydev/react-calendar/blob/master/src/components/Calendar.jsx)

## Engineering
